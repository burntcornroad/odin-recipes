        <li>2 Tbsp Freshly-Squeezed Lemon Juice</li>

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Lb Pasta</li>
        <li>2 Cups Cherry Tomatoes chopped</li>
        <li>1 Bunch Parsley chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin, rinse your lentils thoroughly. Cook them in salted water according to your package's instructions. You should be left with about 2 1/2 – 3 cups cooked lentils.</li>
        <li>Bring the olive oil to medium heat in a large sauté pan. Add in the chopped white onion, and sauté for about 2-3 minutes. Then, add in the lentils and spices, and sauté for about 5 minutes, or until lentils have crisped a little in the oil.</li>
        <li>Next, cook the pasta of your choosing in salted water until al dente. If not serving immediately, rinse the pasta in cold water after draining to stop the cooking process.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, make the garlic yogurt. In a bowl, add in the yogurt, and grate 2 cloves of garlic directly into the yogurt. Add in the salt, lemon juice, and herbs, and mix. Taste, and adjust seasonings to your preference.</li>
        <li>To make the paprika butter, melt the salted butter in a small saucepan and add in the paprika. Once the butter is completely melted, turn off the heat and mix the paprika into the butter for about 1-2 minutes, to bloom the spice. Be careful not to brown your butter!</li>
        <li>Lastly, chop up your tomatoes and parsley.</li>
        <li>To assemble, have each person put a portion of pasta in their bowl. Top the pasta with a dollop of the yogurt sauce, then layer on the sautéed lentils, tomatoes, and parsley. Drizzle everything with the paprika butter. There are no set ratios – just add everything to your own preference!</li>
    </ol>
